Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while Im in a transitional period so I dont wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I cant give you this case, it dont belong to me. Besides, Ive already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.")
